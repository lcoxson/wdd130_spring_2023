    <h2>Laura Coxson</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Laura Coxson. I am just starting a degree in software development. I am married, and my wonderful husband and I have two beautiful children. 
    <p>I currently teach piano lessons, and have taught for 13 years now. I have worked in a lot of different jobs, including finance, restaurants, and a print shop. I took my very first coding class last semester, and I'm excited to learn about web design this semester. I feel it may be something I would enjoy, and I'm interested in exploring the option.</p> <p>My favorite scripture is Isaiah 12:2 - "Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation." </p>
