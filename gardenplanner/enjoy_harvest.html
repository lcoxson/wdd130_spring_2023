                <h1>Enjoy the Harvest</h1>
                <p>There are so many great ways to enjoy the harvest! Here are a few of our favorites. </p>
                <p>PEPPERS - As the main ingredient: stuffed peppers, roasted peppers, cheesy pepper boats, pepper egg rings, air-fried peppers, fresh with dip. Peppers make a great addition to: stir-fries, breakfast hash, soups, salads, scrambled eggs or omelets, burritos, sweet & sour, pasta sauce, and so much more! Our favorite way to store them: roughly chopped, frozen, and bagged. It makes it so easy to toss them in to any cooked dish. I haven't tried thawing and using in place of fresh peppers, but I would imagine the texture would be quite different. </p>
                <p>GREEN ONIONS - Use the tops to garnish and add a little flavor to stir-fries, soups, salads, etc. Use the more substantial parts of the stalks and the bulbs to add onion flavor to any dish. Our favorite way to store them: chopped, and frozen in bags. They are easy to break apart as long as you don't pack them in tight, and are easy to add to cooked dishes for a flavor boost.</p>
                <p>TOMATOES - Fresh tomatoes are a delight in salads, on sandwiches (BLT anyone?) or as a snack. Tomatoes are a great addition to soups, sauces, stir-fries, omelets, and breakfast hash. Our favorite way to store them: Cherry tomatoes freeze well, but last year we roasted several batches and packed them in olive oil. They were a delicious replacement for fresh tomatoes all year!</p>
                <p>CARROTS - We are still discovering ways to use and preserve carrots, but in the meantime we are really enjoying them fresh! I felt bad just throwing away the carrot tops - well, throwing them to the feathered composters (bok bok!). I researched a few ways to use carrot tops, and we ended up making carrot-top pesto with carrot tops, dried basil, nuts, salt, and garlic. I'll be packing it into jars and keeping it in the freezer for use all year.</p>
