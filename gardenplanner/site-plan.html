        <h3>I Love Gardening!</h3>
        There are many wonderful reasons, but one stands out among them: gardening has been wonderful for my mental health. Something about having dirt under my fingernails and fresh produce on my table makes such a difference to me. It's hard to be pulled into an anxiety spiral when you've got the sun on your face, the promise of fruits and vegetables and flowers to come, and a weird little bug to watch. 

        <h3>Why put this on a website? </h3>
        I decided to put this on a website because it would make sharing my gardening plans easy. I can share my successes and failures, my ideas, and my recipes with anyone - friends and family who don't live near, local gardening groups, and anyone interested in ideas for a small home garden.

      <h3>Check out my plants!</h3>
      <p>
        <h3>New This Year</h3>
        <p>Very early this spring, I planted peas and carrots. They took a while to start - I planted before we could turn the drip system on, so watering was sporatic and infrequent. However, they have both done very well! They have been easy and productive. By early June, my family had already started enjoying snacks of the thinned baby carrots and crunchy sweet peas. We thinned carrots a little late, but that meant they were big enough to eat. My son has enjoyed picking peas and watching them grow, and was excited to help me thin carrots and see how much they had changed in just a few weeks. And a few weeks after thinning, we had some ready to harvest. How exciting!</p>

        <h3>Our Garden Favorites</h3>
        <p>SWEET PEPPERS - We love sweet peppers, and would eat them every day if we could! This year, I planted thirteen pepper plants.</p>
        <p>TOMATOES - We are particularly fond of garden tomatoes. They make a wonderful snack right out of the garden, sprinkled with a little salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>BLACKBERRIES - A sweet perrenial treat! Blackberries are easy to grow, tolerate heat and sparse waterings, and produce sweet, juicy berries.</p>
        <p>WATERMELON - Our watermelon plant went wild last year! It did very well in zone 7a, and we had several medium-sized, sweet melons to eat and share.</p>
        <p>GREEN ONIONS - Green onions are an easy, quick-growing alternative to their larger, bulb onion cousins. They are ready to use not long after planting, and can provide excellent onion flavor and a nice garnish to many dishes. They are also easy to plant around other plants, or in containers.</p>
        <p>RHUBARB - Another rewarding perrenial plant. The leaves and roots are poisonous, so be sure to plant it in a spot that's harder for kids and pets to go. The stalks have many wonderful uses, and it's easy to grow a large amount!</p>
        <p>CUCUMBERS - A refreshing garden treat! In 2022, I grew lemon cucumbers. They were small, crisp, and a fun bright yellow. They had spines ("trichomes"), but I picked with gloves on, and gave them a quick rub before putting them in my basket. </p>

        <h3>Struggles</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, things don't go to plan. Here are a few things I have struggled with, and how I plan to move forward:</p>
        <p>I planted beets early this spring, but they did not do well. I think the issue was that they didn't get enough water soon enough. The sprouts were small and slow-growing, and I ended up pulling them to make room for tomato plants. The sprouts were tasty though, and would be fun to grow as a microgreen!</p>
        <p>Last year, I planted an artichoke. I didn't do enough research though, and thought it would be a perennial plant. In some places, it absolutely is - but my zone gets just a little too cold in the winter, and we had a long, cold, wet winter! It didn't come back, and I haven't replaced it. I think if I did a little more research on how to grow, feed, harvest, and protect artichokes, I could absolutely have success next time!</p>
        <p>You might be surprised to find peppers here - they were also in my list of garden favorites! However, last year I made the mistake of planting peppers in the same bed as my tomatoes. The tomato plants took off long before the pepper plants did, and ended up smothering several plants and stunting the others. This year, my tomatoes are in their own bed, and the peppers have lots of space to grow without competition. They've also gotten a healthy dose of fertilizer this year!</p>
        <p>Pumpkins round out this list. Last year, I planted several pie pumpkin plants with high hopes for an easy, bountiful harvest. However, we got a squash bug infestation that completely wiped out all of our plants by the end of the season. We did end up with a few small pumpkins, but they really only worked as decorations. This year, I have avoided planting anything in the cucurbit family, to hopefully discourage squash bugs from visiting our garden again next year!</p>

        <h3>Trees</h3>
        <p>I have two fruit trees in my yard - an Italian prune, and a pear. This is the first year they are producing fruit. Pears are one of my son's favorite fruits, and he could eat them all day. I have an issue with the texture of a lot of fruit, but dried plums (aka prunes) are one of my favorite things! I am looking forward to trying some from my own backyard. I am considering a few other fruit trees, but it's hard to decide which ones! Apples are always a favorite. Cherries are wonderful, but have to be protected from the birds. Peaches are sweet and delicious, but are prone to peach borers, which will kill the trees. Nectarines are another of my favorites. There are too many great choices, and not enough space!

      <h3>Enjoy the Harvest</h3>
      <p>
        <p>There are so many great ways to enjoy the harvest! Here are a few of our favorites. </p>
        <p>PEPPERS - As the main ingredient: stuffed peppers, roasted peppers, cheesy pepper boats, pepper egg rings, air-fried peppers, fresh with dip. Peppers make a great addition to: stir-fries, breakfast hash, soups, salads, scrambled eggs or omelets, burritos, sweet & sour, pasta sauce, and so much more! Our favorite way to store them: roughly chopped, frozen, and bagged. It makes it so easy to toss them in to any cooked dish. I haven't tried thawing and using in place of fresh peppers, but I would imagine the texture would be quite different. </p>
        <p>GREEN ONIONS - Use the tops to garnish and add a little flavor to stir-fries, soups, salads, etc. Use the more substantial parts of the stalks and the bulbs to add onion flavor to any dish. Our favorite way to store them: chopped, and frozen in bags. They are easy to break apart as long as you don't pack them in tight, and are easy to add to cooked dishes for a flavor boost.</p>
        <p>TOMATOES - Fresh tomatoes are a delight in salads, on sandwiches (BLT anyone?) or as a snack. Tomatoes are a great addition to soups, sauces, stir-fries, omelets, and breakfast hash. Our favorite way to store them: Cherry tomatoes freeze well, but last year we roasted several batches and packed them in olive oil. They were a delicious replacement for fresh tomatoes all year!</p>
        <p>CARROTS - We are still discovering ways to use and preserve carrots, but in the meantime we are really enjoying them fresh! I felt bad just throwing away the carrot tops - well, throwing them to the feathered composters (bok bok!). I researched a few ways to use carrot tops, and we ended up making carrot-top pesto with carrot tops, dried basil, nuts, salt, and garlic. I'll be packing it into jars and keeping it in the freezer for use all year.</p>
